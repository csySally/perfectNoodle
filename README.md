## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- React: A JavaScript library used to build the user interface.
- Next.js: A React framework that provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and simplified routing.

### Styling

- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. It provides the foundation for the app's layout and basic styling.
- Custom CSS: For more complex animations and transitions that go beyond Tailwind's capabilities.

### Animations

- Lottie: An animation library that renders Adobe After Effects animations in real-time. Used for the smooth, high-quality cooking animations and steam effects.

### Backend Logic

JavaScript: The programming language that powers the app's logic and interactivity, managing the timer countdown, user input, and notifications.

### Desktop Application

Electron.js: A framework that allows you to package your web app as a desktop application for Windows, macOS, and Linux, combining the power of web technologies with native functionality.

## Development Approach

The app's UI is primarily built with React and Tailwind CSS for efficient development. For the complex animations showing noodles cooking and steam rising, we use Lottie to ensure smooth, high-quality animations that would be difficult to achieve with CSS alone. This hybrid approach gives us both development speed and superior visual quality.
